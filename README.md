Generic Software Front-End Project

Generic Software is a design experiment to showcase my front-end skills and responsive capabilities. The site is built with Ruby on Rails and is hosted on Heroku. While the site was built with Bootstrap, no premade template was used. The site includes many stock images and a stock video that have not been optimized.
